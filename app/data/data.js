Using the lastest technology in memory it features 512MB of DDR3 memory that compliments the performance of the system. Graphics was very important as we wanted to include 3D gaming. To achieve this we installed a Mali 400 graphics processor. High Definition Streaming of movies, gaming, and music was a must, so we added a Wireless N radio that is capable of speeds up 250 megabits, to ensure blazing fast downloads. Our 1.4 HDMI plug n play interface allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector and supports 3D Video. Included is 8GB of internal storage for storing music, movies, documents, games and more. We put a USB port on the back for a keyboard, a mouse, external hard drives and anything else you can plug in. Heat was a major concern for a form factor this small. For this reason we chose the most energy efficient Arm CPU per watt. We worked tirelessly on a case that would disperse the heat but handle the dust. Equiso is very quiet as there are no moving parts. We truly hope your enjoy our product.</p>",

The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p>This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand&#8230;something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse!</p>\n\n<p>The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since!</p>\n\n<p>It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You&#8217;ll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord&#8230; and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason&#8230;cause you had their back.</p>\n\n<p>Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture&#8230;. Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment!</p>\n\n<p>Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful!</p>\n\n<p>Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com. Phone calls from solicitors will not be returned.</p>",

To achieve these pioneering effects, RaNA uses single-stranded oligonucleotides to target the repressive interactions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with specific genes of interest, thereby upregulating mRNA and increasing expression of the encoded protein. RaNA is applying its proprietary technology to develop new treatments in several therapeutic areas, with an initial emphasis in the fields of rare genetic disorders, oncology, metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.

All Saluti Cahn efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices recommendations were implemented by Lincoln.

Donations of $.25 cents will be made for each new member that signs up to SocialTrak.

Thatâ€™s why SocialTrak takes social networking and social media closer to your local area.  SocialTrak offers customized networks based on geography, personal interests, and career fields.  We are launching in New England, a region that offers so much professionally, academically, culturally and socially.  Our goal is to simplify the social networking experience and enable people to make more valuable personal and business connections.â€ </p>\n\n<p>Initially, SocialTrak will focus on geographic areas around New England including Boston, Cape Cod, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.

Unlike other social networks, members can create as many profiles as they want while still controlling the privacy settings of each profile.   </p>\n\n<p>SocialTrak strives to become the â€œone stop shopâ€ where members can link and manage other accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Flickr, as well as blogs and RSS feeds.  The company is developing new applications to increase user experience including web conferencing, email marketing and event planning.  </p>\n\n<p>Small businesses, professional organizations, and educational institutions that want to set up their own privately branded networks can partner with SocialTrak to customize, host and manage these networks.  </p>\n\n<p>SocialTrak was originally conceptualized when Mr. Lupton wanted to establish a social intranet in his residential complex. Currently self-funded, SocialTrak plans to begin monetizing site traffic through advertising and business partnerships. </p>",

The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. </p>\n\n<p>Prof. SoljaÄiÄ‡&#8217;s team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This â€œstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  </p>\n\n<p>Prof. SoljaÄiÄ‡ was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship (also known as â€œGenius Grantâ€) in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the â€œTop Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008â€ by Technology Review, â€œTop 100 Science Stories of 2007â€ by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: â€œThe Year in Ideas â€“ 2007.â€</p>",
