         "overview":"<p>BioVentures Investors has three funds currently under management; all focused on the commercial development of advanced technology in Life Sciences and Healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>We know this industry. We have seen its potential from the inside, from the boardroom, the lab bench, and the patient bedside. Given economic and demographic trends, there is a rapidly growing market need; there are tremendous advances in biotechnology and materials science. This is a great opportunity for the informed and involved investor. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, investing in private life sciences and healthcare equity has produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plans of potential investments. Because of the cyclical nature of the life sciences and healthcare public equity markets, we seek opportunities that build a defensive portfolio with a variety of liquidity options.</p>\n\n<p>With the dynamic expansion in medical and life sciences research over the past 30 years, large, multinational pharmaceutical and medical device companies have come to rely on entrepreneurial, research-driven biotechnology and medical device companies to provide them with new products. This continues to drive a strong market for new ideas with demonstrated economic and medical value.</p>\n\n<p>The three General Partners have all been CEOs of companies active in the life sciences and healthcare industry, with over 62 years of combined experience and a proven record of identifying and developing promising technologies. As a result, they have extensive networks in the biotechnology industry&#8217;s scientific, investment, and professional communities that can be leveraged by the firmâ€™s funded entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>We are active investors, taking board seats in most of our portfolio companies. We led or co-led six of the seven deals closed to date in Fund III.</p>\n\n<p>BioVentures does not expect portfolio companies to achieve profitability or significant sales during its ownership. Instead, our focus is to finance clearly identified scientific experiments and operational goals, which, if successful, will reduce uncertainty and dramatically raise value. Our primary goal during the ownership period is to perfect the patent portfolio and demonstrate efficacy and utility.</p>\n\n<p>Eastern Massachusetts is a world center for the development of life sciences and healthcare technology. The numerous basic science and clinical research institutions in the area allow the General Partners to remain current in the sciences and to access the opinions of leading researchers for deal evaluation. Furthermore, the Cambridge / Boston community is rich in support services in the firmâ€™s areas of interest, such as patent counsel, law firms, regulatory experts, accountants, bankers and business consultants.</p>\n\n<p>The General Partners enjoy excellent, established relationships with the communities critical to building new companies. They have had decades of contact with the scientific, legal, investment and consulting organizations specializing in life sciences and healthcare. In addition, they have established reputations within life sciences and healthcare and bring added value to their investments in the form of management and scientific expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Venture investing is time-consuming, and demands the active participation of fund Partners. Therefore, BioVenturesâ€™ funds have what the Partners believe is an optimal ratio of capital under management and Partner time allocation. Both the size of the firmâ€™s funds and the firmâ€™s proximity to emerging technology allows the Partners to work closely with portfolio companies, to meet regularly with the managers of new ventures, and to stay current on technology and the financial environment. The entire BioVentures team stays current with all portfolio investments, allowing any of us to step in when special expertise is required.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, investing in private life science and healthcare equities has generally produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plan presented by potential investments. BioVentures invests in an assortment of new technologies at varied developmental stages to construct a &#8220;market basket&#8221; of ventures with varied risk profiles and time horizons, seeking multiple exit routes whenever possible. The firmâ€™s preference is to invest in a company at the first institutional round.</p>\n\n<p>BioVentures currently has over $145 million under management. Investments in individual companies typically range from $3 to $7 million dollars. Fund Partners typically take board seats, or in those transactions in which we do not lead or co-lead, attend all Board meetings as observers. In our current fund, we hold board seats in all of our major investments.</p>",

Combined with our interactive remote, Equiso will truly refine your TV experience.</p>\n\n<p>Watch stunning 1080p HD content from Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and many more! Send emails, update your facebook status, play Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja like never before. Download new apps, create and display a powerpoint, listen to music, read books, and play most all those interactive games you love so much on your phone or tablet.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine showing up to do a presentation, and all you had to do, was plug it in, grab your remote, and you&#8217;re ready to go. Game night with your buddies is now easier than ever.  Bring your device with you in your pocket, plug in and play. Our 1.4 HDMI 1080p port allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector. This enables any of these devices to instantly become a Smart TV and eliminates the need for extra cables. </p>\n\n<p>A Remote like no other</p>\n\n<p>This remote is like nothing you have ever experienced before. Advanced accelerometers and gyros sense your gestures, turning them into life like interaction with your Smart TV. Soft touch buttons on top add to your Smart TV experience. Simply flip the remote over and it becomes a full keyboard, no pain staking tasks of typing letter by letter on the screen. Flip it back over and your gesture remote is back in full action to conquer that next level of Angry Birds or Tower Defense. Don&#8217;t worry about accidentally pressing the buttons on the keyboard. Our gyros sense the remotes position and turn off the keyboard as you glide your way around.

Using the lastest technology in memory it features 512MB of DDR3 memory that compliments the performance of the system. Graphics was very important as we wanted to include 3D gaming. To achieve this we installed a Mali 400 graphics processor. High Definition Streaming of movies, gaming, and music was a must, so we added a Wireless N radio that is capable of speeds up 250 megabits, to ensure blazing fast downloads. Our 1.4 HDMI plug n play interface allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector and supports 3D Video. Included is 8GB of internal storage for storing music, movies, documents, games and more. We put a USB port on the back for a keyboard, a mouse, external hard drives and anything else you can plug in. Heat was a major concern for a form factor this small. For this reason we chose the most energy efficient Arm CPU per watt. We worked tirelessly on a case that would disperse the heat but handle the dust. Equiso is very quiet as there are no moving parts. We truly hope your enjoy our product.</p>",

Playing games earns money for fashionable looks, new moves on the dance floor, or money to give to charity.  At launch, players will be able to begin building their fashion empire as they level up to become a top fashion designer.  Soon they can also aspire to become a dance master or the ultimate chef in order to throw the party of a lifetime, all in the name of a real charity of their choice.  Hangout is about having fun with friends, meeting new people, and making a difference!</p>\n\n<p>Hangout Uniquely Integrates Social Games with a Virtual World\nEach game we publish seamlessly plugs into the same virtual world, so players keep their avatars, possessions, and status from game to game.

Products The company operates in four segments: Breast Health; Diagnostics; GYN Surgical; and Skeletal Health. BREAST HEALTH PRODUCTS The company&#8217;s breast health business offers a line of breast imaging products, including the Selenia full field digital mammography system, a series of screen-film mammography systems, breast biopsy image guidance systems, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for both screen-film and digital mammography, and DirectRay digital detectors. Its breast health business also includes its Interventional Breast Solutions family of products including breast biopsy devices, its MammoSite radiation therapy system and the MammoPad breast cushion. The company&#8217;s photoconductor coating business, which it acquired in connection with its acquisition of its selenium coating capabilities for its digital detectors, is also a component of its breast health business. DirectRay Digital Detector: The company&#8217;s DirectRay flat panel detector technology employs an amorphous selenium (a-Se) photoconductor to directly convert x-ray photons into an electrical signal. Selenia Full Field Digital Mammography System: The Selenia full field digital mammography system is based on its proprietary, amorphous selenium DirectRay digital detector, which preserves image quality by using amorphous selenium to directly convert x-rays to electronic signals, without first converting them to light. This direct conversion process preserves image sharpness by eliminating light diffusion.</p>",

The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p>This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand&#8230;something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse!</p>\n\n<p>The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since!</p>\n\n<p>It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You&#8217;ll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord&#8230; and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason&#8230;cause you had their back.</p>\n\n<p>Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture&#8230;. Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment!</p>\n\n<p>Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful!</p>\n\n<p>Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com. Phone calls from solicitors will not be returned.</p>",

To achieve these pioneering effects, RaNA uses single-stranded oligonucleotides to target the repressive interactions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with specific genes of interest, thereby upregulating mRNA and increasing expression of the encoded protein. RaNA is applying its proprietary technology to develop new treatments in several therapeutic areas, with an initial emphasis in the fields of rare genetic disorders, oncology, metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.

After an operational procedure has been dissected and analyzed, industry-standard â€œBest Practicesâ€ content, efficiencies, and controls are implemented.  Then, Saluti Cahn can produce hyperlinked Word document procedures as an end product.  These updated, documented procedures are then used for staff re-training and reference. </p>\n\n<p>Advantages of Using Saluti Cahn\nSaluti Cahn strategically limits the number of projects accepted, enabling the principals, Dr. Dean Saluti and Marjorie Cahn, to be at the Client sites working with their staff at all times.  Dr. Saluti personally conducts procedural-level workflow analysis.  Marjorie Cahn personally reviews, tests, and edits completed Word document procedures.  This ensures superior-quality output.  Also, FTE cost savings realized from Saluti Cahn efficiencies provides immediate ROI.  Saluti Cahnâ€™s reasonable billing for an entire project is, in most cases, completely paid from ROI realized within the first month of project assignment.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of Retirement Operational Efficiencies Projects:</p>\n\n<p>2008 to 2009: Vanguard Retirement Services (www.RetirementPlans.Vanguard.com) \nâ€“ After only five months, Saluti Cahn identified significant operational efficiencies, resulting in 90 potential FTE cost savings â€“ approximately $4.5M. Dissected and documented all assigned critical Recordkeeping Operations procedures in order to implement controls and Industry Standard Best Practices. \nReference: Kristina Harris (610-669-8188)</p>\n\n<p>2007 to 2008: Pentegra Retirement Services (www.Pentegra.com)\nâ€“ Dissected and documented all assigned critical Recordkeeping procedures (over 100), implementing controls and Industry Standard Best Practices. Significant FTE cost savings were also realized through efficiencies identified. \nReference: Gwen Burroughs (914-821-9430)</p>\n\n<p>2006 to 2007: Lincoln Financial (http://www.lfg.com/LincolnPageServer?LFGPage=/lfg/lfgclient/act/ret/index.html) \nâ€“ In the first three weeks of assignment, Saluti Cahn identified 9+ FTE cost savings in the Fort Wayne, IN New Business, Participant Call Center, and Transaction Research units. All Saluti Cahn efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices recommendations were implemented by Lincoln. The Fort Wayne, IN New Business Unit realized a 50% reduction in Plan conversion time. \nReference: James Racine (260-455-4944)\n 2005 to 2006: MFS (www.MFS.com)\nâ€“ Saluti Cahn reduced the time required for new Plan conversion by more than 50% and created efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices for the New Business unit.  Technical, single subject matter expert (SME) procedures, such as Customized Pricing and Plan Document Creation were dissected and documented. FTE cost savings enabled MFS to allow attrition to reduce headcount.<br/>\nReference: Catherine Manganese (617-954-6812)</p>\n\n<p>2005 to 2006: Wachovia, Retirement Fees Unit (www.wachovia.com)\nâ€“ Dissected and documented over 70 Fees procedures in order to implement controls and Industry Standard Best Practices.  Significant efficiencies were realized.\nReference: Angie McDaniel (704-590-8771)</p>\n\n<p>2003 to 2005: FASCore Retirement Services (www.FAScore.com)\nâ€“ Dissected and documented several hundred procedures, implementing efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices.  Developed the data element Field Design for an Upfront Web Application to be used by both the Plan and FASCore for new Plan setup data entry. This Project also reduced the data entry Fields by identifying irrelevant Fields, duplicate data elements, and those Fields that should be hardcoded. \nReference: John Fellin (303-737-1229)</p>\n\n<p>2002 to 2004: BISYS Retirement Services (http://www.bisysretirement.com) \nâ€“ Dissected and documented all assigned critical Recordkeeping Operations procedures in order to implement efficiencies, FTE cost savings, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices.

Donations of $.25 cents will be made for each new member that signs up to SocialTrak. New users will be able to choose from 12 different charities. </p>\n\n<p>Jonah Lupton, SocialTrak founder, said, â€œConnecting locally is a more powerful and effective way to network. Thatâ€™s why SocialTrak takes social networking and social media closer to your local area.  SocialTrak offers customized networks based on geography, personal interests, and career fields.  We are launching in New England, a region that offers so much professionally, academically, culturally and socially.  Our goal is to simplify the social networking experience and enable people to make more valuable personal and business connections.â€ </p>\n\n<p>Initially, SocialTrak will focus on geographic areas around New England including Boston, Cape Cod, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.

The company is developing new applications to increase user experience including web conferencing, email marketing and event planning.  </p>\n\n<p>Small businesses, professional organizations, and educational institutions that want to set up their own privately branded networks can partner with SocialTrak to customize, host and manage these networks.  </p>\n\n<p>SocialTrak was originally conceptualized when Mr. Lupton wanted to establish a social intranet in his residential complex. Currently self-funded, SocialTrak plans to begin monetizing site traffic through advertising and business partnerships. </p>",

By taking a do it yourself approach, they avoid the high development costs and long development timetables typically associated with business application development. \nMobile apps created with ViziApps can access all the native resources of the target device, such as camera, GPS, audio recording, contacts and calendar. Those apps are also able to access back end data across the Internet in a Google Docs spreadsheet, SQL database or Web Service. All app design, including the data management design interface, is performed without coding. App users are automatically updated in the event of any subsequent changes to the application design. </p>\n\n<p>www.viziapps.com</p>",

         "overview":"<p>WiTricity Corp. was founded in 2007 to commercialize an exciting new technology for wireless electricity invented two years earlier at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). </p>\n\n<p>A team of physicists, led by Professor Marin Solja developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. </p>\n\n<p>Prof. Solja team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This âœstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  </p>\n\n<p>Prof. Solja was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the Top Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008 by Technology Review, Top 100 Science Stories of 2007 by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: The Year in Ideas  2007.</p>",
